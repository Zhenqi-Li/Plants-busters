Motivation:  Many people think taking care of plants  is easy, but it is actually a lot of work to keep them alive and healthy.  People tend to kill due to lack of watering, over watering, and not keeping plants in the right environment that they need in order to grow and flourish. We want to give people the opportunity of growing plants without the worry. Having reminders and a set timing  on when to water the plants and how water each plant needs, will help people keep their plants alive! This will help people who do not have a green thumb (someone who has a natural talent for growing plants) have one.
